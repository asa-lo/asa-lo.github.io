                I’m a humble team player, yet I don’t have any issue to roll up my sleeve when push comes to shove. I
                have expertise in HTML, CSS and WordPress. I like to structure, prioritize and plan my work, because I
                often work with many parallel activities.
                <br>
                I study Web Development at Mid Sweden University and take my degree at 2021. Currently I freelance as a
                web developer at webbnord.se where I assist in developing websites for small to medium sized companies.
